## 🌐 Overview

Meet our Discord AI chatbot, a savvy guide to the XRPL Documentation. Nestled in a Discord channel, it aids XRPL developers in unraveling the mysteries of the XRPL ecosystem. From answering XRPL queries to firing up XRP transfers and even featuring a nifty NFT claiming functionality for XRPL-concocted NFTs.

## 🤖 Front-end: Discord Bot

Our Discord bot is the face of the project, engaging with users in the channel, digesting their messages, and sparking lively interactions.

## 🛠 Back-end: Python & JS Scripts

Beneath the surface, our Python scripts, LLM, and JavaScript dance in harmony. They chew over user inquiries, consult with the OpenAI API for witty comebacks, and relay them back to our ever-ready Discord bot.

## 🎨 NFT Claiming Feature

Eyes here for the pièce de résistance! Claim your XRPL-developed NFTs in a flash:

1. Type `Claim NFT` to the bot.
2. It kickstarts a chain reaction, summoning a pre-minted NFT via a magical mix of Pintata (IPFS), Infura, Lexica Art AI, and XRPL POAP API.
3. Our Firebase application becomes the NFT's new home.
4. A QR code, your gateway to this NFT, is born and promptly shared.
5. Scan away, be led to our Firebase haven, and claim using the Xumm Wallet.

### 🧐 How to Use

1. Spark a chat with our bot on Discord.
2. For your very own NFT, type `Claim NFT` and follow the yellow brick road - or rather, the QR code.
3. Reach the end, the hosted NFT on Firebase.
4. Victory dance as you claim your NFT.
